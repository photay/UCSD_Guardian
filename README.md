#UCSD Guardian Data Visualization Section

####**Welcome to the section of the Guardian, the UCSD official newspaper, that works on visualizing data. Our goal is to great visualizations that acurately represent data whilst also providing story.**

#####**Tools We Use:**
• Code is done primarily Python
• Use the Jupyter/ Ipython 3 Notebook to write code: http://ipython.org/
• Code is combined on Github. Our url: https://github.com/photay/UCSD_Guardian.git
• The visualization libraries we use are Bokeh, Lightning and Matplotlib ◦Lightning: http://lightning-viz.org/
◦ Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/
◦ Matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/
◦ Useful Link: http://pbpython.com/visualization-tools-1.html


#####**Guidelines for Acquiring and Using Data:**
• Every visualization must cite and link the original data sources
• Every visualization must cite a paragraph summary of the changes made to the data for transparency
• Every visualization must include a sentence about fallcies of the data. Examples include how the data was collected,groups it left out, methods in used during it collection. All of these can affect how accurate the data is. 

#####**Visualization Guidelines:**
• 1. Colors: ◦Keep in mind color scheme for newspaper print and readers who may be colorblind. 
◦The Tableau 20 has lists of color schemes for different situations. Link here: http://public.tableau.com/profile/chris.gerrard#!/vizhome/TableauColors/ColorPaletteswithRGBValues
